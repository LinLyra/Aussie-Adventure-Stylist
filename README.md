# Aussie Adventure Stylist
*Dress in harmony with your destination.*

Aussie Adventure Stylist turns a destination—or a photo of it—into a **color-smart travel outfit**. It extracts a landscape palette, factors in local weather and your wardrobe, and generates a one-click packing guide with a short “why this works” explanation.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Photo → Palette**: Upload a scene (beach, bushland, desert) and get a clean color palette to anchor outfits.
- **Weather-aware picks**: Temperature, wind, and conditions guide layers, footwear, and sun protection.
- **Wardrobe-aware**: Prioritizes items you already own (tops, bottoms, shoes, accessories).
- **Season & activity styles**: Summer/Autumn/Winter/Spring vibes plus hiking, beach day, city, wildlife, photography.
- **One-click guide**: Generates a tidy, copy-ready checklist with a narrative rationale you can share.

## 🧭 Why it matters
Travelers often overpack, under-prepare for weather, and end up with outfits that don’t fit the place—or the photos. This project makes packing **faster, lighter, and better looking** by aligning your wardrobe with the landscape you’re visiting.

## 🖼️ Example Scenarios
- **Blue Mountains hike** – High UV + breezy lookouts → sun hat, windbreaker, grippy boots; palette echoes eucalyptus greens and sandstone ridges.  
- **Sydney Harbour evening** – Sea breeze → light layers, comfortable walking shoes; blues and neutrals mirror the waterline.  
- **Great Ocean Road road trip** – Coastal wind/spray → light rain shell, sturdy footwear; oceanic blues with cliff neutrals.

## 🔧 How It Works
1. Enter a destination or upload a destination photo.  
2. The app extracts a color palette from the scene.  
3. It blends **palette + weather + wardrobe** to suggest items.  
4. You receive an outfit list and a brief **Why** section, ready to copy as a packing guide.
